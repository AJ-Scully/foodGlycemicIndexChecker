Uses a food API to get nutrional data of inputted food. It then caluclatyes the glycemic index of said food and
determines its range on the GI Scale (eg High, Medium, Low). This Started of as a program to test the food API i
wanted to use with my group project but i wanted to turn it into something useful.
